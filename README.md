# personal-portfolio

## General Information

This repository houses the current build of my personal portfolio website. This project was built so as to better represent my abilities in web development (full stack development) and further work as a centralised point to access more information about me. A basic design of the desired web platform can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/KKP7CBfZuGCs80q9LqlfzE/Personal-Portfolio-Website-%7C-2022---Present?node-id=0%3A1) as designed on Figma.

In brief, the project has been built through the implementation of ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, THREE.js, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Firebase. The current build of the website can be seen [here](http://jim-t-kelly.web.app), as hosted by Firebase.

## Setup

Please be aware the setup to build and run this website differs respective to each operating system (OS). Furthermore, I'm also assuming that you already have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [React](https://reactjs.org) already installed or available within your environment.

### Run

```bash
cd ./personal-portfolio
npm install
npm run
```

### Build

```bash
cd ./personal-portfolio
npm install
npm run build
```

This will then launch the application within the native web browser on your computer.

## Future Plans

Future developments to this website will naturally come over time as I gain further experience and insight into what I would like to do with the platform. At this current point in time the only primary  development I would like to make is to further develop the THREE.js integration to better work on mobile devices.
