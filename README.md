<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This repository houses the **current** build of my personal portfolio website. This project was built so as to better represent my abilities in web development (full stack development) and further work as a centralised point to access more information about me. A basic design of the desired web platform can be seen [here](https://www.figma.com/file/KKP7CBfZuGCs80q9LqlfzE/Personal-Portfolio-Website-%7C-2022---Present?node-id=0%3A1) as designed on Figma.

In brief, the project has been built through the implementation of ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, THREE.js, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Firebase. The current build of the website can be seen [here](http://jim-t-kelly.web.app), as hosted by Firebase.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Please be aware the setup to build and run this website differs respective to each operating system (OS). Furthermore, I'm also assuming that you already have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [React](https://reactjs.org) already installed or available within your environment. After confirming this, you'll need to perform the following steps to prepare your local environment.

- npm

  ```sh
  cd /path/to/your/directory # Navigate to where you want to clone the repository. 
  git clone https://github.com/jamestkelly/personal-portfolio.git # Clone the repository.
  cd /path/to/personal-portfolio # Navigate into the repository.
  npm install # Install the necessary packages.
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jamestkelly/personal-portfolio.git
   ```

2. Install NPM packages

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the website locally to verify it works correctly prior to deployment.

   ```sh
   npm run # Run the bot on your local host
   ```

4. Build and then deploy the web application to any hosting service you prefer.
   
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

This project can be used as an example or starting point for others looking to design, build, and host their own personal portfolio websites. Additionalyl, it predominantly works to represent my most current abilities as a developer within web frameworks, namely with THREE.js, hosting, and pipelining.
